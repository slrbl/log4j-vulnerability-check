# log4j-vulnerability-check
Find log4j JARs and check them for vulnerability using MD5 hash

## About
To find vulnerable log4j JARs, this tool will do the following
### 1.Find all the log4j
Using 
```
find / -name *log4j*jar
```
### 2.Hash them using md5sum
```
find / -name *log4j*jar -print 2>/dev/null -exec md5sum {} \;
```
### 3.Check if the resulting hashes are in the vulnerable hashes list
Using a local file or an online one
<br> The default vulnerable hashes source is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slrbl/CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes/main/md5sum.txt

## Usage
```
$ python check_log4j.py -h
usage: script_v2.py [-h] [-l LOCAL_HASHES_FILE] [-o ONLINE_HASHES_FILE]

Check for the vulerable log4j JARs in your system

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOCAL_HASHES_FILE, --local_hashes_file LOCAL_HASHES_FILE
                        A local file that contains the hashes
  -o ONLINE_HASHES_FILE, --online_hashes_file ONLINE_HASHES_FILE
                        An online resource that contains the hashes
```
